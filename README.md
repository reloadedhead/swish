# Swish

A lightweight web application to transfer YouTube playlists into an Apple Music account. 

# Implementation
This app uses [Remix](https://remix.run) for the full-stack part and a _weird_ combination of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [HeadlessUI](http://headlessui.com/) components.
